# Project Title: Analyzing Banking Trends: Customer Transactions and Regional Impact

Overview:
In the dynamic world of banking and finance, understanding customer behavior and the regional impact of transactions is paramount for decision-making and strategic planning. This project delves into the realm of banking trends by exploring and analyzing extensive transaction data to gain valuable insights into customer behavior patterns and their influence on different world regions.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to uncover the intricacies of customer transactions and identify trends that may impact regional economies and financial systems. Using Python for data cleaning and SQL queries for analyzing interconnected tables, our aim is to gain a comprehensive understanding of how customer transactions vary across different regions and their potential implications for the banking sector.

Data Sources:
This project leverages three key tables:

world_regions table: Contains data on various world regions, their codes, and names. This table serves as a reference to categorize customers based on their regional affiliation.

user_nodes table: Holds essential details about consumers' banking nodes, including unique consumer IDs, associated region IDs, node IDs, start dates, and end dates. This data helps identify specific banking nodes and the duration of customer association.

user_transaction table: A comprehensive repository of customer transactions, including data on consumer IDs, transaction dates, transaction types, and transaction amounts. Analyzing this data allows us to uncover patterns in customer spending and financial behaviors.
